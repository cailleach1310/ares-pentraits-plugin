# Character Traits
During character generation, you get a fixed amount of points you can spend on defining certain strengths and weaknesses of your character. The more particular deviations from the initial balanced state you want to have, the more points this will cost you.

Character traits are actually pairs of opposing traits. Raising one means to lower the other. Each pair has a total of 20 points, meaning that perfectly balanced pairs have 10 points each.

`traits` or `trait/list` - Shows the character traits of your character.

## Chargen
`trait/reset` - Resets traits to a balanced state. Do this first.
`trait/set <trait>=<value>` - Sets a trait to a value and adjusts the value of the opposing trait accordingly.
`trait/raise <trait>` - Raises a trait by one point and adjusts the value of the opposing trait accordingly.
`trait/lower <trait>` - Lowers a trait by one point and adjusts the value of the opposing trait accordingly.

## Checking Traits
During rp, players can choose to check a trait. This is usually absolutely optional, it is a way you can use to determine how your character will react in a particular situation.

The outcome is decided by a roll of a 20-sided die. Outcomes can be one of the following:

* critical success - the result is exactly the value of the trait. 
* success - the result is below the value of the trait.
* failure - the result is below 20 and above the value of the trait. This will automatically trigger a check of the opposing trait.
* critical failure - the result is a '20' and means a critical success of the opposing trait. 

`trait/check <trait>` - Checks a trait

## Advancing Traits
It is possible to advance traits over time. Each critical success or failure, or a success in a particularly critical situation can be considered as a reason to qualify for a trait raise. As this depends a lot upon context, it is vital to put in a +request along with a log reference. Admin will review this and possibly ask for another trait check to determine whether a trait is advanced. The adjustment of the trait can only be made through admins of the game.
